This Neural Network rates whether a food is healthy or not, there is a healthiness level from 0-10, as well as a boolean decision(healthy or not)

Note: the training data right now is very rudimentary. In future versions, I will add more and better data, add these data to tuning.py, find the best configuration, and change that as the configuration for the app.py
